              <hr>
              <p>
                Achill Island and the Curraun Peninsula are the jewels of County Mayo. A perfect playground for walkers
                that love the 360º of beautiful views. Unlike many other popular walking destinations in the west of
                Ireland, where access to the land is becoming increasingly restricted, most of the countryside on Achill
                is in common ownership, which means that it is freely open and accessible for hillwalking.
                Our guided walks are mostly easy, and perfect for hikers of all ages and levels of fitness.

              <hr>
              <p>
                For a long-distance walk in Clare, the Burren Way is a great choice. The Burren is well known for its
                unusual landscape and what better way to experience the limestone pavements than on foot. Winding its
                way from Lahinch to Corrofin, the karst landscape of bedrock makes for a piercing contrast to the deep
                emerald green of the Atlantic swell below. It will take around five days to make your way along the
                quiet tarmac roads, forest paths, tracks and up a few of the sweat-inducing climbs. Distance: 114km

              <h3>Cliffs Of Moher Coastal Walk</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>
                This route offers a much better way to see the Cliffs of Moher than simply parking up across the road
                from them. Walk to the cliffs, and you’ll enjoy the best views on the approach! The complete Cliffs of
                Moher Coastal Walk is 18km long, but really you can start and finish anywhere, so make it as short as
                you like. But be warned, this route is along an exposed clifftop path, so it requires some common sense
                and a healthy level of fitness. Combining steep ascents, flagstone steps and farm tracks, the Cliffs Of
                Moher Coastal Walk is a tough but spectacular walk. It will take four and a half hours and is waymarked
                with a blue arrow on a white background. The usual starting point is Liscannor.

              <h3>Killary Harbour Coastal Walk</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>
                Carved by ancient glaciers, Killary Harbour is Ireland’s only fjord. Surrounded on three sides by
                towering mountains and hills, including Mweelrea, the Devilsmother, Ben Gorm and Leenane Hill, this is a
                magnificent place to walk. If you’d prefer your walk to stay relatively low level but take in the views
                of these stunning peaks, the 16km coastal trail is ideal. This is a relatively easy walk to do despite
                its 16 km, and the trail consists mainly of minor roads and old farm roads. You can get there either by
                bus or by car and the start and finish are located at a junction on the N59 and the road to Bunowen.
                Starting and finishing at the junction of the N59 and the road to Bunowen, follow the old famine road on
                the southern side of the fjord to Killary Harbour Youth Hostel. Then return on the minor inland road
                which passes Lough Muck and Lough Fee to complete the loop. The walk will take roughly 6 hours.

              <h3>The Sligo Way</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>
                The Sligo Way is a waymarked long-distance walking route which starts at Lough Talt on the Sligo Mayo
                border (R294). It continues eastwards for approximately 80km/50 miles along the line of the Ox
                Mountains, ending at Dromahair, Co Leitrim. With intriguing archaeological and geological features along
                the route. The Sligo Way covers a range of terrain, including quiet country roads, laneways and forest
                tracks. The walk is signposted using a combination of wooden marker posts and metal finger posts. It can
                be walked in sections or in its entirety which is estimated would take approximately 3 days.
                The flora along the Sligo Way is typical mix of blackthorn, heather, primrose, fox glove and many other
                plants. You’re also likely to encounter fallow deer, stoats and pine Martens along the route, while
                above are sparrowhawks, finches and peregrine falcons. Look out for rowan trees with their reddish bark;
                the Celts believed these trees were sacred and that they protected against evil spirits.
                These trails may have some climbs and may have an uneven surface where the going is rough underfoot with
                some obstacles such as protruding roots, rocks etc. The routes are appropriate for people with a
                moderate level of fitness and some walking experience. Specific outdoor walking footwear and clothing is
                recommended.

              <h3>Mount Brandan</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>
                In the whole of Ireland there is no place that has such a wealth of historical monuments, Gaelic
                culture, literature and spectacular rugged scenery than can be found on the Dingle Peninsula. The Sliabh
                Mish and Brandon massif form a backbone to the peninsula, and Brandon is regarded by many as the very
                finest mountain in Ireland. Views from here on a fine day (or even not so fine) will rival the most
                beautiful & best to be found anywhere in the world!!!
                This is a wonderful walk with a well-marked path. With varied topography, many people find this path
                difficult. In some areas, adventurers must have a higher level of fitness and expertise. Faha ridge not
                for the heart fainted but doable on a clear day. The weather can change quickly, so be prepared with the
                appropriate equipment.
