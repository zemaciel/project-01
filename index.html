              <p>
                Peter Woods is the founder of Trails West. Born in Achill Island, Co.Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland, Peter spent his youth rambling the rugged fields and mountains that surrounded him. Experienced climber and mountain navigator,
                he
                started Trails West to share his passion with other people: "My dream was to find a way to bring people to the unknown parts of Ireland and immerse you into nature, fresh air, amazing landscapes".

                Originally from County Clare, Aisling grew up near the Burren region and that scenic senary always inspired her passion for the outdoors. After two years of travelling abroad and exploring other landscapes, she returned to Ireland and
                worked in the Hospitality Industry until joining Trails West, organising accommodation and transportation for our adventures customers.

                Nik Reddi has been living in Killarney, Co. Kerry, for almost 5 years. His interest in mountains and walking has taken him to various parts of the world. Trekking in the Canadian Rockies and Kashmir in India have been among his
                favourite
                experiences. However, he enjoys the mountains on the west coast of Ireland the most.
